# The STRONG AYA Knowledge Representation

Welcome to the STRONG AYA Knowledge Representation.
This resource is intended to provide an overview of the knowledge representation used in the STRONG AYA project.  
The knowledge representation is based on the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/),
which is a standard model for data interchange.  
RDF has features that facilitate data interoperability even if the underlying schemas differ,
and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the
data to be changed.

## How to explore this resource

This resource is organised into two different segments that are closely intertwined,
and each provide a crucial aspect of the knowledge representation in STRONG AYA.

- **[The STRONG AYA Knowledge Graph](/AYA-cancer-semantic-map/AYA-cancer-data-schema/Knowledge_Graph/)**: This segment provides an
  overview of the STRONG AYA Knowledge Graph, which is used to organise and represent the complex relationships between
  different concepts, measurement instruments, and data collected in the STRONG AYA project.
- **[The STRONG AYA Semantic Mapping](/AYA-cancer-semantic-map/AYA-cancer-data-schema/Semantic%20Mapping/)**: This segment provides detailed information
  about various concepts and their mappings within the STRONG AYA infrastructure.
