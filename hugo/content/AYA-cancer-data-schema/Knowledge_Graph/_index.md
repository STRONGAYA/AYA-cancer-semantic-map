# The STRONG AYA Knowledge Graph

This resource is used to organise and represent the complex relationships between different concepts,
measurement instruments, and data collected in the STRONG AYA project.
It helps in visualising and understanding the connections and dependencies within the data,
facilitating better analysis and decision-making.


## How to explore this resource

The STRONG AYA knowledge graphs are separated into three main -non-exhaustive- graphs for clarity, consisting of:

- [*a Data Graph*:](./data/) _that is representing a graph of all the different concepts collected for STRONG AYA_.
- [*a Data Source Graph*:](./data-source/): _that is representing a graph for the different data sources used for STRONG AYA. That is for example, a patient reported outcome measure, doctor reported outcome measure, et cetera)_.
- [*an Instrument Graph*:](./instrument/): _that is representing a graph for the different instruments used for STRONG AYA. In this case, exemplified through the EORTC QLQ-AYA_.
